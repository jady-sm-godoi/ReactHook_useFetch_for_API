This code exports a custom React hook called `useFetch` that takes in two parameters: `url` and `options`. When this hook is called in the code, it will fetch data from the specified URL and return the result and loading state.

The hook utilizes React's built-in hooks such as `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useRef`. The `useState` hook is used to manage and update the state of `result` and `loading`. `useRef` creates a mutable reference for `url` and `options` which can be modified without triggering a re-render. 

The `useEffect` hook runs functions based on specific variables or conditions being met. In this code, there are two separate `useEffect` hooks. 

The first `useEffect` hook observes changes to the `url` and `options` variables, updates the `shouldLoad` state, and triggers a re-render.

The second `useEffect` hook runs when `shouldLoad` is changed. This hook fetches data from the `url` and sets the state of `result` and `loading` accordingly. If the component using the hook is unmounted before the fetch is complete, the useEffect's cleanup function aborts the request and clears the data so that no error occurs. 

Finally, the hook returns an array containing `result` and `loading`.


Here's an example of how you can use the `useFetch` hook in a React component:

```
import React from 'react';
import { useFetch } from './useFetch';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [data, loading] = useFetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1', {});

  if (loading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{data.title}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

This example fetches data from the specified URL using `useFetch`. The loading state is used to display a message while the data is being fetched. Once the data has been fetched, it is displayed on the screen (`data.title`). 

Note that the second parameter, `{}`, is an options object that can be used to configure the request (e.g., method, headers, body, etc.). In this example, no options are passed in so the default options will be used. You can also pass in any options supported by the Fetch API.
